# suizerli

[**suizerli**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/suizerli_logo.PNG) is a flutter project that I use for training purposes.

The main idea of the app is, to allow users to recommend what they love.
A recommendation could be about a great movie, an amazing song, a special bar or a beautiful
restaurant and much, much more - just use your imagination!



If a user likes your recommendation, he will spend you some suiz, which will then add to your suizbank.

A first look onto the design (**suspect to change**):

- First, you will have to sign up: [**SignUpScreen**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Register.png)

- Next, here comes the sign in: [**LoginScreen**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Login.png)

- After the first sign in, you will choose what kind of recommendations you are interested in: [**ChooseInterests**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Choose%20Interests.png) 

- Now, that suizerli got to know you better, it is time to check your homescreen for the first time! [**HomeScreen**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Home.png)

- If a recommendation looks interesting to you, just click it! [**RecommendationDetail**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Recommendation%20-%20Detail%20Yamaha.png)
(if you liked it, dont forget to spend some suiz to the author! ;) )

- To get more recommendations from that author, just open his profile and follow him: [**ProfileDetail**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Profil_1.png)

- To find new topics or authors to follow, just use the [**ExploreScreen**](https://github.com/heslegend/suizerli/blob/master/custom_assets/Explore.png)
